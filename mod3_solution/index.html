        of town? And at this particular moment, just after he pulled off the big time and was making off with the greenbacks. Was there another 
        crook who'd had the same idea, and was now watching him and waiting for a chance to grab the fruit of his labour? Or did the steps behind 
        him mean that one of many law officers in town was on to him and just waiting to pounce and snap those cuffs on his wrists? He nervously 
        looked all around. Suddenly he saw the alley. Like lightning he darted off to the left and disappeared between the two warehouses almost 
        falling over the bin lying in the middle of the pavement. He tried to nervously tap his way along in the inky darkness and suddenly stiffened: 
        it was a dead-end, he would have to go back the way he had come. The steps got louder and louder, he saw the black outline of a figure coming
